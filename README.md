## Features

### Helper Class

Baseline supports all helper classes (e.g. block width, cards, etc.) from [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal).

Please refer to [minimal.guide](https://minimal.guide) for all available features.

### Customization

Selected features are enabled by default. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) is **_not_** required.

However, if you prefer to customize your own experience, Baseline provides extensive customization options.

## Philosophy

### Less _and_ more

As software design continues to evolve, Obsidian's interface is starting to show its age. Many highly customizable themes stick to Obsidian's default style, while more opinionated ones compromise on customizability.

This simple and modern customizable theme fills the gap, with tools designed to make your transition seamless. **Baseline** strives to become the baseline for everyone's Obsidian experience moving forward.

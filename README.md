## Features

### Helper Class

Baseline supports all helper classes (e.g. block width, cards, etc.) from [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal).

Please refer to [minimal.guide](https://minimal.guide) for all available features.

### Customization

Select features are enable by default, [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)
is **_not_** required.

However, if you prefer to customize your own experience, Baseline provides most options from [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/), [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/), and [Things 2](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things/), with more to come.

## Philosophy

### Less _and_ more

As software design continues to evolve, Obsidian's interface is starting to show its age. A lot of the highly customizable themes stick to Obsidian's default style, while opinionated ones compromise on customizability.

A simple and modern customizable theme is created to fill the gap, with tools designed to make your transition more seamless, **Baseline** strives to become the baseline for Obsidian experience moving forward.

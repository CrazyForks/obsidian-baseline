## Features

### Helper Class

Baseline supports all helper classes (e.g. block width, cards, etc.) from [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal).

Please refer to [minimal.guide](https://minimal.guide) for all available features.

### Customization

Selected features are enabled by default. [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) is **_not_** required.

However, if you prefer to customize your own experience, Baseline provides extensive customization options.

## Philosophy

### Less _and_ more

As software design evolves, Obsidian’s interface is beginning to show its age. Many customizable themes stick too closely to the default look, while more opinionated themes often sacrifice flexibility; or to be blunt, simply don’t look good.

With a clean, modern foundation and endless customization possibilities, Baseline aims to become the starting point, **the baseline for everyone's Obsidian experience**.
